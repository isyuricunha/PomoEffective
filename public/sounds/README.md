# YuPomo Sounds Folder

Place your custom notification sounds in this folder. Then, in Settings, set the Sound field to the file name (including extension), for example:

- `ding.mp3`
- `bell.wav`

Notes:
- Keep files small (<200KB preferred) for fast loading.
- Supported formats depend on the browser/OS (mp3, wav, ogg are common).
- If you set the Sound to `beep`, YuPomo will use the built-in oscillator beep instead of a file.
- Path used at runtime: `/sounds/<your-file>`.
